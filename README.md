The Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) Calculator estimates your number of calories required to keep your body functioning at rest, also known as your metabolism. The user fill all the inputs with their own weight, height and age. Also they choose their gender and their daily exercise routine. The calculator will calculate and display the BMR result and also Harris-Benedict equation (HBE) result.
